# Hexagonal Architecture

Hexagonal architecture, also known as **Ports and Adapters**, is a pattern that isolates the core application (domain) from external concerns like databases, user interfaces, or third-party APIs.

## When to Use

-   **Complex Domain Logic:** Systems where the core business rules are complex and need to be tested in isolation.
-   **Long-Lived Applications:** Projects expected to evolve over years, where technology choices (databases, frameworks) might change.
-   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Enables writing tests for the core logic without mocking heavy external dependencies.

## Key Concepts

1.  **Domain:** The heart of the application. Contains entities, value objects, and business rules. No external dependencies.
2.  **Ports:** Interfaces that define how the outside world interacts with the application (Driving Ports) and how the application interacts with external systems (Driven Ports).
3.  **Adapters:** Implementations of the ports. For example, a REST controller (Driving Adapter) or a Postgres repository (Driven Adapter).

## Example Structure (NestJS)

```typescript
src/
  domain/                 # The hexagon core
    model/
    ports/
      in/                 # Use cases / Services interfaces
      out/                # Repository / External Service interfaces
  application/            # Orchestration layer
    services/
  adapters/               # The outside world
    in/
      web/                # Controllers
    out/
      persistence/        # Database repositories
```

## IronBackend Support

IronBackend can configure your AI assistant to strictly follow this structure:

```bash
npx @ironbackend/cli init cursor --style hexagonal
```

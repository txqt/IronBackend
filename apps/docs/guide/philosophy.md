# Philosophy

IronBackend is built on three core beliefs about the future of AI-assisted software engineering.

## 1. Context is King
AI models are smart, but they lack context. Without guidance, they produce generic, often "spaghetti" code. IronBackend provides the **context**—via architecture rules and project structure—so the AI knows *exactly* where code belongs.

## 2. Standards over Configuration
We opinionatedly select the best stacks and patterns (e.g., Modular Monolith, Zod, Fastify/NestJS) so you don't have to waste time debating boilerplate.

## 3. Production First
Most AI demos show simple scripts. Real software needs:
-   Validation (Input/Output)
-   Error Handling
-   Logging
-   Security Headers

IronBackend bakes these into every generated file.
